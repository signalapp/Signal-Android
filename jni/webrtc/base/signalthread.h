// SignalThread - Base class for worker threads.  The main thread should call
//  Start() to begin work, and then follow one of these models:
//   Normal: Wait for SignalWorkDone, and then call Release to destroy.
//   Cancellation: Call Release(true), to abort the worker thread.
//   Fire-and-forget: Call Release(false), which allows the thread to run to
//    completion, and then self-destruct without further notification.
//   Periodic tasks: Wait for SignalWorkDone, then eventually call Start()
//    again to repeat the task. When the instance isn't needed anymore,
//    call Release. DoWork, OnWorkStart and OnWorkStop are called again,
//    on a new thread.
//  The subclass should override DoWork() to perform the background task.  By
//   periodically calling ContinueWork(), it can check for cancellation.
//   OnWorkStart and OnWorkDone can be overridden to do pre- or post-work
//   tasks in the context of the main thread.
