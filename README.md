# Signal Android 

Signal is a messaging app for simple private communication with friends.

Signal uses your phone's data connection (WiFi/3G/4G) to communicate securely, optionally supports plain SMS/MMS to function as a unified messenger, and can also encrypt the stored messages on your phone.

Currently available on the Play store.
